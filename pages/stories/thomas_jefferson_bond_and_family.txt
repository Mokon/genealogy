Thomas Jefferson Bond & Family
Thomas Jefferson Bond, the son of Jonathan Bond was born in Londonderry New Hampshire at the turn of the 19th century. He was born into a new nation expanding across the United States. The story of his family is rich with history and certainly one which is worth being told. Here we will look at Thomas Jefferson Bond and his family from both a political and business standpoint.
Politics and Business
Thomas’ grandfather was Dr. John Bond Senior, the town doctor of Hampstead New Hampshire. He was most likely acquainted with some of the signers of the declaration of independence and was a well-respected individual in his community. This civic and political involvement seems to have been passed down as his grand children were involved in the political life of their time as will be seen. Thomas, however, never knew his grandfather as his grandfather died in 1804 two years before he was born in 1806. 
Thomas’ father, Jonathan, grew up in Hampstead where he began his life as a cabinet maker. He, however, was not only a craftsman. He was also a businessman being referred to as a trader around New England. Entrepreneurship seemed to run in Jonathan’s blood as he, and later his son Thomas would prove to be businessmen of their era. One source says that at one point in his life he had a large business in supply the material for “braiding poplar stuff for hats.” 
Jonathan and his wife had Thomas in 1806, in the second year of Thomas Jefferson’s second term as the President of the United States. One can presume Jonathan was a supporter of Thomas Jefferson’s policies as one does not name their child after a political figure they do not support.
Thomas Jefferson the president was one of the founders of the Democratic - Republican Party, a party which formed in opposition to Federalists. They called themselves republicans but became later known as democrats due to their support of democratic principles over the Federalist’s fear of power being given to the common man. The Democratic-Republican Party supported a small central government and an agricultural society, being perhaps closest to modern day libertarians. Their support came mostly from farmers as well as the working class and craftsmen in towns. This was in contrast to Federalists who supported a strong central government and government meddling in the economy. The Federalist gained most of their support from urban areas, businessmen, and the upper class.
The naming of his son leads one to believe Jonathan Bond was a member of the Democratic Republican Party. This is further supported by how two of Jonathan’s son’s: Isaac and Amos Bond were active in the political arena. 
These brothers were mentioned in an article in the New Hampshire, Patriot published in Concord on November 27th 1837. The article said:
To the Democrats of Concord. The enemy, who has contested every election saving alone that of the present year in this town for the last thirty years, is again in the field throughout the State. Encouraged and emboldened by the success which has attenended their efforts in other democratic States- the old federalists of twenty-five years ago who had retired from the contest are again buckling on the armor of party warfare, determined, if possible, once more proudly to trample on the democrats and punish them for having so long taken upon themselves to govern themselves rather than be governed by such as contend that they were born with the right to rule, and that it was the duty of the people to submit. 
The present “armor and attitude” of the “peace party in war, and the war party in peace” in New Hampshire is scarcely regretted. If the old federalists have a disposition to show their teeth and even bite, the democrats know how to meet them: let the Aristocracy in the abundance of the heart speak out their intentions from the mouth. We know how to defend ourselves, to parry their thrusts, and in the end to disarm and defeat them. In order seasonably to commence this work, we invite the Democratic Citizens of Concord one and all to meet at Gass’ Hall on SATURDAY THE NINTH DAY OF DECEMBER NEXT,  at four o’clock in the evening, them to hear such addresses and pass such resolutions as may embody the reasons of faith that is in us.
All those who believe that the rights of the whole people rather than the benefits of the rich and the few should be respected: all who approve the policy which has been invariably supported and practiced by the democrats of this State in all times- of making the objects of the government few and the burdens of taxes light- of confining the General Government to the defined objects of the Constitution, and discountenancing that waste of millions and millions of dollars which the federalists have endeavored to vote for pretended objects of internal improvements: All who are opposed to buying up tho people’s votes with the people’s money- to taxing the pockets of the laborer that the speculator may grow rich on the expenditure:  All who would restrict Banks and other corporations from the power to abuse the confidence which the Legislature confided in them, and compel them to discharge all their just obligations: In short, all who desire to tread in that path , and practice those doctrines which JEFFERSON and a LANGDON have laid down and which ANDREW JACKSON and MARTIN VAN BUREN have sedulously attempted to practice, and which the Aristocracy of this State are now arming themselves to prostrate: Are earnestly desired to meet at the above mentioned time and place.
In 1827 ONE HUNDRED DEMOCRATS of Concord first commenced rolling the ball that prostrated an intolerant fraction and wrested abused power from the hands of the federalists, and put an end for ten year to the reign of terror and proscription. Let SEVERAL HUNDRED DEMOCRATS of the same town now set an example which shall prove that power cannot return to the hands of their oppressors without a brave and determined struggle.
This article was signed by many citizens of Concord including Isaac T. Bond and Amos Bond and was dated Concord, November 25th 1837. This shows that two of Thomas’ brothers were democrats. By this time the Federalist Party had collapsed and the National Republican Party, later to be known as the Whig party, had taken their place. Given that his brother’s and father were of this political persuasion it seems probable that Thomas was also a democrat. Thomas also named one of his son’s Thomas Jefferson.
Like his dad, Thomas was also a business man. Thomas lived on the Londonderry Turnpike in Bow New Hampshire and he sold tobacco products. One of the places he sold his products was just northeast of the state house on North Main Street in Concord next to the old American House in 1836 in Dr. Thomas Brown’s store. Interestingly Thomas was married to an Ann Brown. Perhaps in some way related to Dr. Thomas Brown, though no such evidence has been found.
By this time Thomas’ father, Jonathan, had moved to Bow where he was listed as a wheelwright. At one point Thomas’ brother Isaac also lived next to him on the Londonderry Turnpike. It is said that Isaac and he were in business together. Later Isaac was a grocer living in Manchester New Hampshire.
Thomas, however, would pass away at an early age of 41. His father would out live him and in the 1850 census his father lived on a farm where other paupers and idiotic people lived. Jonathan was listed as a pauper. After Thomas’s death his children carried on his legacy and were pillars of the community.
His Children
Thomas had at least nine children. Not much is known about his child James B. Bond but the rest of his children have interesting stories.
Thomas Jefferson Bond Senior’s wife passed away in 1865 but may have lost her facilities earlier as in 1859 Benjamin A. Noyes of Bow was given guardianship of Abby J. Bond, Maria E. Bond, and Henry T. Bond, all minors at the time.
Margaret A. Bond (1827-1902)
The eldest child Margaret A. Bond (1827-1902) went on to marry Edward Weatherbee Harrington (1816-1876) in 1849. This was Edward’s second marriage as his first wife had widowed him two years earlier. 
In the 1850 census Margaret lived with her husband in Manchester. Her husband was a ristorator with $4,000 dollars’ worth of real estate. There were 13 people in the house including the last names of Harrington, Corliss, Grimes, Robey, Bond, and Denail. Horace Corliss and her sister Nancy J Bond lived in the house.
In the 1860 census she lived with her husband in Manchester. Her husband was listed as having an occupation as something City Bank. The value of his real estate was $3,000 while the value of his personal estate was $10,000. A Maria Bond lived with them. This was Margaret’s younger sister.
In the 1870 census she lived with her husband in Manchester. Her husband was a bank cashier. He had $15,000 worth of real estate and $5,000 worth of personal estate.
In the 1880 census Margaret lived with her son Edward and his wife in Manchester. She was widowed. She kept house while her son was a bank clerk.
In the 1900 census Margaret lived with her son Edward and his wife. She was widowed. There was a servant in the household.
Margaret’s husband was a man of great influence. Edward grew up in Massachusetts and came to Manchester where he worked as a brick layer at the Amoskeag Mills. From here he went into construction, and in 1839 he opened the first restaurant in Manchester. In 1853 when the City Bank was founded he became their cashier. After this bank shut down he became the cashier of the new bank, the City National Bank. It seems being a cashier at the time was a much greater position of authority than it is today as Edward lived very well. He served on the boards of directors of several banks and companies. He was the treasurer of the Savings Bank before his death. He was also the treasurer of the Manchester and Lawrence Railroad.
Edward was also very involved in his community. He was a foreman and engineer in the Fire Department, a free mason of the 33rd degree and the grand high priest of the grand chapter of the state of NH, and a Captain in the Stark Guards. In 1859 and 1860 Edward was elected mayor of Manchester. Some newspaper articles from the time show there was much controversy between him and abolitionists. He was a democrat as mayor and he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1860, 1864, and 1876. The fact that he was a democrat once again supports the conclusion that Thomas was most likely a democrat.
Margaret and Edward’s child Delena Benurs (Harrington) Curtis lived a colorful life as well. She married Samuel Curtis, a well to do clothing merchant. She, however, had a 30 year affair with the married Frank Jones: a two term Congressman, Mayor of Portsmouth New Hampshire, railroad baron, a hotel magnate, and a beer brewer. Frank Jones left her nothing and she sued his estate. She was awarded $150,000.
John R. Bond (1829-1897)
The eldest son of Thomas Jefferson Bond was . John was the eldest son of Thomas and moved to Manchester after his father’s death. Here he became an expressman, or perhaps one who delivered packages. In one newspaper clipping from the period he was referred to as “John R. Bond, popular express messenger of this city.” Interestingly his nephew, Sally Chandler, (through Abigail J. Bond (1839-1903)) married James W. Hill, nephew of Bushrod Hill, the owner of the largest express company in Manchester. Bushrod sold his express business to American Express. Later in his life John worked as an expressman for American Express: the modern day credit card company that started as a package delivery company. John’s son Charles was born in Ohio and his son John H. went on to be a music teacher and musician in Manchester. More about him can be read in the direct family line description of him.

Charles Henry Bond (1846-1908)
Moving away from the children of Thomas Jefferson Bond to a related person Charles William Milton Bond (1798-1884) of Saugus Massachusetts was the brother of Thomas Jefferson Bond. He was a snuff manufacturer. This Charles married Sally Sweetser (1795-1882) and had a child Charles Milton Bond (1819-1899) who married either Mary Amerige or Margaret M. Foss. He was also a snuff manufacturer and lived in Hampstead New Hampshire as well as Saugus Massachusetts. They had a child Charles Henry Bond (1846-1908) who lived in Saugus, Massachusetts who married Martha Augusta Morrison and later Isabella Bacon.
This Charles became very wealthy from his cigar business. He was president of the Boston based Waitt & Bond, Inc., manufacturers of Blackstone and Totem brand cigars. He commissioned the Bond Building in Washington D.C. and visited that city quiet often.
After he made his fortune in the Cigar business it seems he pursued other interests including his love of music and the performing arts. He was a patron of the arts funding the education of many musicians. He lost a large amount of his fortune in the panic of 1907. He was found dead in a half filled bath tub in 1908 with a note:
I have been killed by my friends and enemies. It is more than I can bear. I can stand it no longer. My heart is broken. I leave everything to my wife.
CHARLES H. BOND
It is still unknown if this was an accident or a suicide. Throughout his life he was a real estate developer and philanthropist as well. The interesting point in relation to Thomas Jefferson Bond is he was also involved in the tobacco business as we have seen along with his father and grandfather. One can conjecture that his grandfather and grand-uncle Thomas Jefferson Bond worked alongside each other in their tobacco businesses. The Waitt and Bond Company became one of the largest and best known cigar manufacturing companies in New England.
