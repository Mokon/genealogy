The Bow Controversy & John Noyes
John Noyes (1720-1770) moved from Massachusetts up into Suncook where he was given land by the proprietors with the condition that he stay in the town for a number of years as their blacksmith. There however was a problem. Bow was a grant from New Hampshire and Suncook was a grant from Massachusetts. Both of these grants overlapped. This stemmed from the fact that for a number of years there was an ongoing legal battle between Massachusetts and New Hampshire on the state line. The fact that people in Bow and Suncook both laid claim to the same land caused another series of legal battles between the two groups of people one the state line issue was resolved. This became known as the Bow Controversy.
John Noyes was involved throughout the process having become a lawyer later in this life and in 1758 it was his petition that finally officially granted Suncook Township. At one point he was forced to collect taxes against his fellow residence of and in 1758 and 1759 he paid the Bow proprietors to settle claims against his land. Each of these issues stemmed from this controversy.
