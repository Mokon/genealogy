In "Historical Sketch of Ship Building on the Merrimac River" by John James Currier there is a fascinating reference which could refer to this John Bond or his grand father. Here two ships are mentioned which together form the name John Bond. On Nov 6 1708 there was the Ship John of London which had a round sterned and was about 120 Tons built at Newbury in 1708. And on May 31 1709 there was the Ship Bond of London which had a square sterned and was about 310 Tons and was built at Newbury in 1708. It is also highly possible that these are entirely unrealted to this Bond.

From that book: "It appears that a few years after the settlement of Newbury Capt John Cutting shipmaster and Mr Thomas Milward mariner who in 1640 owned a shallop and were engaged in the fisheries at Cape Ann came to Newbury."

Also: "In volume seven of the Massachusetts Archives to be found at the State House in Boston which has never been printed I find a Register of all such ships and vessels concerning the owners and property whereof proof hath been made upon oath before William Stoughton Lieut Gov of Massachusetts Bay in New England etc according to directions of the Act of Parliament passed in the seventh and eighth year of the Reign of King William the Third entitled An Act for preventing Frauds and Regulating Abuses in the Plantation Trade From this Register it appears that there were 130 vessels built on the Merrimac river and vicinity from the year 1681 to 1714 Of these over 100 were built at Newbury f They were mostly small sloops ketches and brigantines from twenty to fifty tons burthen The first ship in this list is the Ship Samuel and David of Boston Lewis Hunt master a square sterned vessel of about 100 tons built at Newbury in 1703 and her tonnage exceeded that of any other vessel built in this vicinity previous to this date They were owned principally in Boston but many of them appear to have been built on foreign account I find no less than eleven vessels built during these years at Newbury for English owners and described as follows 

...

The largest tonnage in the entire list of 130 vessels was that of the ship Bond of London 310 tons mentioned above"

The Bonds of Weymouth
===============================================================================
From: Sir Francis Drake's West Indian Voyage, 1585-86

11. BARK BOND, 120-150 tons, owned by John Hawkins, Treasurer of the
Navy (Andrews, Eliz. Privateering, p. 90), although George Bond, mayor of Plymouth, may have had an interest (Laughton, Armada, I, 31 n.). Captain Robert Crosse. She was with Drake in 1588 and was used as a fire ship, with £600 being allowed to her owner (Corbett, Sp. War, pp. 236, 237; Laughton, Armada, II, 287, 326, 337). Cf. p. 145.

From: Elizabethan Privateering: English Privateering During the Spanish War 1585-1603
One Weymouth merchant syndicate which prospered was that of John Bond, William and Richard Pitt and William Holman, who set forth the so-ton Bark Bond in 1589. That year she brought in a Brazilman worth about £5,000 and in 1990 a leaguer worth about £700. The following year Bond and the captain, Roger Geyer, combined with Robert Sadler and Edward Leckland, owners of the Globe of London, to fit out the two privateers, which shared a £3,000 prize with the Swallow of London. In 1992 Captain Nicholas Ayers sailed the Bark Bond into Weymouth with a rich haul of jewels. These he had illegally and forcibly obtained from the Grace of Dover, which had been entrusted with putting the Madre de Dios passengers ashore in the Azores. The jewels were impounded, but Ayers had probably taken another prize this voyage. In 1595 the Bark Bond went with the Scorpion and the Violet to the West Indies in a venture promoted by John Bond and a group of Londoners. Prizes to the value of £1,500 resulted. Such returns seem profitable enough. Bond, who had been a factor for Richard Pitt before the war, had the Jesus and the Bark Bond on reprisal before 1590; Richard, William and Henry Pitt had acquired commissions for the Matthew and the Lion at the beginning of the war; William Pitt collaborated with Nicholas Jones in a 1590 venture and had some share in an early voyage of the Riall; Henry Pitt set forth the Aid of Lyme in 1590; and John Pitt had an interest in the Carouse as well as the Eleanour of Southampton in the late eighties, owned the Mayflower in 1993 and joined with Bond to send out the Seraphim in 1595.
