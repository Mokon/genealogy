22. Ebenezer Eastman' (Philip-, Roger"), born in Haver- 
hill, Mass., Feb. 17, 1681 ; another record says born Jan. 10, 
1687. The first record is from Haverhill records, and ought 
to be correct. He married March 4, 17 10, Sarah Peaslee 



EBENEZER EASTMAN^ OF HAVERHILL, MASS. 21 

(spelled by some Peasley), daughter of Col. Nathaniel and 
Judith (Kimball) Peasley and grandson of Dr. Joseph Peasley. 
The latter was born in Haverhill, Mass., Sept. 9, 1646 ; died 
Nov. 5, 1723. Dr. Joseph was the son of Joseph, the 
emigrant, made freeman in 1642. He settled in Haverhill 
before 1746, thence to Amesbury, where he died Dec. 3, 
1660. 

Captain Eastman was the first settler in Concord, N. H. 
There are many interesting facts concerning the part Mr. 
Eastman took in the settlement of Concord ; the services he 
rendered, and the affairs of trust and honor committed to 
his charge, were many. Having considerable property, and 
coming, as he did, at the earliest period of the settlement of 
the town, with his six sons, the eldest of whom was fifteen 
years of age and able to do a man's work, it is no wonder 
that Captain Eastman became in a few years the strong man 
of the town. 

In 1 73 1, his house and home lot were in better order and 
he had more land under cultivation than any other in the 
settlement. From his youth he had been inured to hardships 
and to bold and daring enterprises. When nine years of age 
his father's house was destroyed by the Indians. At the age 
of nineteen he joined the regiment of Colonel Wainwright in 
the expedition against Port Royal. 

In 171 1, when the British fleet under Sir Howenden 
Walker against Canada arrived in Boston, the land forces 
that were to accompany the expedition were organized with 
great despatch, and Mr. Eastman, then about twenty-one 
years of age, had command of a company of infantry, which 
embarked, with others, on board a transport. In going up 
the St. Lawrence river they encountered a violent northeast 
storm, in which eight or nine of the vessels were lost and 
about 1,000 men met a watery grave. The story as related 
by Jonathan Eastman, a grandson of Captain Eastman, is 
that as night came on the orders were that all the vessels 



22 EASTMAN FAMILY OF AMERICA. 

should follow the Admiral's ship, which had a large light 
hoisted at masthead for a signal. Captain Eastman had been 
somewhat acquainted with the navigation of the river, having 
sailed up and down before. In the night the light of the 
Admiral's ship was not to be seen, and it was at the time when 
the fleet was doubling a very dangerous and rocky point or cape. 
When the Admiral's fleet had fairly doubled the cape and got 
into line, the light appeared in such a position as to draw the 
line of shipping directly on to that dangerous point. Aware 
of the danger. Captain Eastman went to the commander, and 
informed him of the peril, and begged him to alter the 
course of the vessel ; but being under the influence of 
liquor, this the captain positively refused to do, saying that 
"he would follow his Admiral if he went to h — ." Captain 
Eastman replied, " Well, I have no notion of going there, and 
if you won't alter the course of the vessel, I will." 

" If you do," replied the captain, "your head shall be a 
button for a halter in the morning." 

Informing his company of the danger and relying on 
their support. Captain Eastman ordered the captain below 
and the helmsman to change his course. Thus they escaped 
the wrecks which befell other vessels of the fleet, by which 
so many lives were lost. The next morning the humble 
captain tendered his acknowledgments to his deliverer, and 
begged his friendship. On the following day the Admiral 
came aboard, and on seeing Captain Eastman abruptly said, 
" Captain Eastman, where were you when the fleet was cast 
away ? " 

" Following my Admiral, sir," replied he. 

" Following your Admiral ! you Yankees are a pack of 
praying devils. You saved yourself, but sent my men to 
h— ! " 

Among the many traditions and anecdotes that are related 
is one that, soon after settling in Concord, he made a journey 
to Haverhill on horseback, and purchased a barrel of 



EBENEZER EASTMAN^ OF HAVERHILL, MASS. 23 

molasses, which he intended in some way to convey home 
with him. He contrived what was called a car, that was 
formed with two shafts, one of which was fastened to the 
horse and the other to drag on the ground. Lashing the 
barrel of molasses on his car, he proceeded on his journey 
homeward along the path through the wilderness. He got 
along very well until he got to the Soucook river, when, after 
crossing and ascending the hill, which was very steep, he had 
got nearly to the top, his horse starting suddenly, the rigging 
gave way, and down went the barrel full speed, and was 
dashed to pieces against a tree. The captain, summoning all 
the patience at his command, exclaimed, " Oh dear, my wife 
will comb my hair, yes, and harrow it too ! " It was truly a 
hard case. 

Captain Eastman went to Cape Breton twice, the first time 
March i, 1745, in command of a company, and was present 
at the reduction of Louisburg, June 16, 1745. He returned 
Nov. 10, 1745. Early the next year he went again, and 
returned home July 9, 1746. He was also a captain in Col. 
Sylvester Richmond's regiment, of Massachusetts, Feb. 6, 
1744. Mr. Eastman lived on the " East Side," was a farmer, 
and was employed for many years in public affairs. He 
commenced a two-story house, but died before it was 
finished. He died July 28, 1748.
