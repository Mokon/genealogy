In "Historical Sketch of Ship Building on the Merrimac River" by John James Currier there is a fascinating reference which could refer to this John Bond or his grand father. Here two ships are mentioned which together form the name John Bond. On Nov 6 1708 there was the Ship John of London which had a round sterned and was about 120 Tons built at Newbury in 1708. And on May 31 1709 there was the Ship Bond of London which had a square sterned and was about 310 Tons and was built at Newbury in 1708. It is also highly possible that these are entirely unrealted to this Bond.

From Book: "It appears that a few years after the settlement of Newbury Capt John Cutting shipmaster and Mr Thomas Milward mariner who in 1640 owned a shallop and were engaged in the fisheries at Cape Ann came to Newbury."

Also: "In volume seven of the Massachusetts Archives to be found at the State House in Boston which has never been printed I find a Register of all such ships and vessels concerning the owners and property whereof proof hath been made upon oath before William Stoughton Lieut Gov of Massachusetts Bay in New England etc according to directions of the Act of Parliament passed in the seventh and eighth year of the Reign of King William the Third entitled An Act for preventing Frauds and Regulating Abuses in the Plantation Trade From this Register it appears that there were 130 vessels built on the Merrimac river and vicinity from the year 1681 to 1714 Of these over 100 were built at Newbury f They were mostly small sloops ketches and brigantines from twenty to fifty tons burthen The first ship in this list is the Ship Samuel and David of Boston Lewis Hunt master a square sterned vessel of about 100 tons built at Newbury in 1703 and her tonnage exceeded that of any other vessel built in this vicinity previous to this date They were owned principally in Boston but many of them appear to have been built on foreign account I find no less than eleven vessels built during these years at Newbury for English owners and described as follows 

...

The largest tonnage in the entire list of 130 vessels was that of the ship Bond of London 310 tons mentioned above"
