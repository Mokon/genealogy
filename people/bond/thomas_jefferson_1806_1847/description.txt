Thomas Jefferson Bond was born in 1806 in Londonderry New Hampshire. He was the son of Jonathan Bond (1766-Unknown) and Abigail Rogers. He married Ann C. Brown (1800-1865) in 1826. He died on February 13th 1847.
Note that the fact that he was son of Jonathan Bond (1766-Unknown) and Abigail Rogers is not definitive but it seems extremely likely that he was. We proceed in this book with that highly probable assumption.
He married Ann C. Brown (1800-1865) in 1826. Their marriage intention is listed as being in Londonderry New Hampshire in the vital records of Londonderry, New Hampshire.
In the 1830 census he lived in Bow New Hampshire with 5 people in the household.
The Rockingham County deeds tell an interesting story in November 1831. In that month Thomas bought a property from a Margaret Brown on the 25th for $150 mortgaged with interest over three years. His occupation was listed as Tobacconist. Five days later and consecutively in the deed book he sold the property for $165. His occupation was listed as Yeoman in this recording. The property was 11 3/4th acres located in Derry New Hampshire. Interestingly in the first deed he was listed as of Bow and in the second deed he was listed as of Hooksett. That was a 10% profit in about one week.
On January 4th 1836 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire that said Thomas had a letter remaining for him in the Post Office at Concord New Hampshire. There was a similar listing saying he had two letters at the post office on October 1st 1836. He had one letter waiting for him on October 1st 1837.
On October 10th 1836 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire that Thomas posted. It said “SNUFF AND CIGAR MANUFACTORY. One door north of Gass’s American House, Concord, N.H. Thomas J. Bond, thankful for past favors, would inform his friends and the public in general, that he still continues to manufacture Scotch, Rappee and Maccaboy Snuff; also, Spanish, half Spanish and American Box Cigars, Long nines and short sixes, smoking Tobacco and other articles in his line. Wholesale and Retail. All orders promptly attended to and all favors thankfully received. Concord, October 1, 1836.” Further research shows the Gass’s American House he mentions here is located at the property on North Main Street in Concord New Hampshire on the north east side of the state house lawn at the corner of Park Street and North Main Street. This American House was a hotel owned by a John Gass. It later burned down and was replaced by the Patriot Building. This also burnt down. The property one door north of the American house would be 125 North Main Street. At this time this lot is owned by The Prescription Center of Concord and holds their store front along with Senator Judd Gregg’s offices. Back in the day Dr. Thomas Brown owned a shop and drug store at this location. In some of Dr. Brown’s advertisements he lists a similar offering of tobacco products which leads one to believe Thomas Bond sold his goods in Thomas Brown’s store.
In the 1840 census he lived in Bow New Hampshire with 7 people in the household.
On December 9th 1841 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire. It shows that he was given guardianship of the person and estate of Bradley Parker. It was dated November 25th 1841.
On January 20th 1842 Thomas sold some land he owned in Hooksett to the Concord Rail Road Company for $225. This is where the rail tracks now lay.
On December 5th 1844 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire. It shows that he was given guardianship of Bradley Parker. He was given a piece of land on the Londonderry Turnpike in Bow so that he could sell this land for the support of Bradley Parker.
There are two sources with differing dates of death for Thomas. His grave stone, which is presumably the most reliable source, says February 13th 1847. A deed says he died on November 15th at nine in the morning. The deed also says that a probate court ruled on his estate October 26th 1847. He had $600 in outstanding debts and demands and they ruled that his wife could sell his estate at public auction. On November 20th 1847 she sold a piece of property for $120. It was in Bow on the Hooksett town line on the Western side of the Londonderry Turnpike. 
On April 1st, 8th 1847 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire. It shows that after his death, the guardianship of Bradley Parker went to Mendell Sampson, both of Bow New Hampshire. The widow of Thomas, Ann C. Bond, notified Mendell to appear in court in regards to the guardianship on the fourth Tuesday of May 1848.
He was buried in Alexander Cemetery in Bow New Hampshire.
His children each have an interesting story told in the story entitled “Thomas Jefferson Bond & Family”.
On June 15th 1859 there was an ad/classified in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire. It shows that Benjamin A. Noyes of Bow was given guardianship of Abby J. Bond, Maria E. Bond, and Henry T. Bond along with some land to cover the expenses.
On a side note Isaac T. Bond was a neighbor of Thomas in Bow for a while. He also appeared with Amos Bond on the Concord voter rolls. Isaac moved to Manchester sometime after Thomas’s death. Isaac, Amos, and Thomas were most likely brothers.
He has 9 children who were:
    • Margaret A. Bond (1827-1902)
    • John R. Bond (1829-1897)
