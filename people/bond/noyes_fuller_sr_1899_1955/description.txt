Noyes Fuller Bond Sr. was born on December 29th 1899 son of Walter Pearly Bond (1860-1928) and Abigail Miriam Fuller (1863-1919) in Hopkinton New Hampshire. He was the younger of two boys and was born into the beginning of the progressive era in the US. He married Susie Mildred Josephine Brown (1899-1965) on April 27th 1920 in Manchester New Hampshire.  He died in June 1955.
In the 1900 census he lived in a house owned by his father in Hopkinton New Hampshire. His father was a farmer.
In 1904 his mother and father were divorced.
In the 1910 census he lived with his mother at 40 Thorndike street Concord New Hampshire which is the Kimball-Walker School. She was employed as a dress maker.
In the 1917 USCD he was listed as living in Concord New Hampshire at 12 Chandler St. working as a machinist at C. F. & M. Co. His mother and brother were listed as living at their old address and his mother was listed as a dietician
In his September 9th 1918 draft card he was living at 40 Thorndike Street Concord New Hampshire. His occupation was listed as machinist at the Laconia Car Company at Water Laconia Belknap New Hampshire. He is listed as having a medium height and medium build with brown hair and eyes. He registered in Laconia.
In the 1920 census he was rooming with a number of other people at 144 Middle Street in Manchester New Hampshire close to the canal street mills. He was working as a machinist in a machine shop. Susie Mildred Brown was also rooming at that same house with her sister. This was at the start of the roaring twenties.
He married Susie Mildred Josephine Brown (1899-1965) on April 27th 1920 in Manchester New Hampshire. Assumedly he met her as they boarded in the same boarding house. They were married at the start of the economic boom that was the roaring twenties.
In the 1930 census he lived in Lincoln New Hampshire in an apartment rented for $13 a month. He was a machinist at a paper mill, presumably the Parker Young Company in Lincoln New Hampshire. This census was taken at the start of the great depression.
According to his son Noyes his family always had everything they needed during the great depression and really did not suffer. According to Marjorie Blomquist (Noyes’ wife) his sisters did not have many clothes because money was scarce and they had to wash their existing clothing at night for the next day.
According to his son Noyes he worked 6 days a week at the paper mill and never saw his paycheck because the paper mill company owned the house he lived in, the grocery store, and the movie theater. All of these worked on a charge basis. For money for his automobile he would fix cars on Sunday. At one point (perhaps after he moved to Portsmouth) he had a fig garden. He also had to cut his own wood for the stove.
Around 1931 he got a job at the naval yard in Portsmouth New Hampshire which increased their fiscal position.
By 1935 he and his family had moved to Portsmouth New Hampshire.
Around 1935 to 1937 he and his family lived in what seems to have been Seabury Road in York Maine. They did not have electricity in that house, they had to haul water from the well, and it had an outhouse.
On December 6th 1939 he and his wife bought a house at 66 Breakfast Hill Road in Greenland New Hampshire for $3000 with a 5% interest rate. An additional $600 dollars was placed on the mortgage on September 6th 1940.
In the 1940 census he lived in Greenland New Hampshire at 66 Breakfast Hill Road (now 463 Breakfast Hill Road) in a house he owned. This house was valued at $3500. He was employed as a machinist in the navel yard and made $2080 in 1939. This was the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard which was instrumental in creating submarines during World War II.
It seems that in 1941 he didn’t pay $80.24 property taxes and his house went up for tax sale. The mortgage was finally discharged on September 28th 1946.
In the 1943 USCD he lived in Portsmouth New Hampshire on Maple Avenue with his wife. He worked in the navy yard.
