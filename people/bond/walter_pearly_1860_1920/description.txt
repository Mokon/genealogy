Walter P. Bond was born in February 1860 in Manchester New Hampshire son of John R. Bond (1829-1897) and Lucinda Colby (1833-1905) just as the American Civil War was beginning and just as the California gold rush was ending. The exact circumstances of his death are not entirely known. He is believed to be buried in the Masonic section of Vallejo cemetery.
His middle name is Pearly not Philip as some have supposed as proven by his war records.
In the 1860 census he was 4 months old living in Ward 2 of Manchester New Hampshire. His father’s occupation was listed as mechanic and his father did not own the property they were living in.

On November 10th 1875 in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper published in Concord there was a mention of him. The article said “A sixteen year old son of John R. Bond of Manchester, while out gunning recently, by the bursting of his gun, has his hand badly injured.”  This was Walter.
On August 14th 1878 in the New Hampshire Patriot newspaper in Concord New Hampshire there was a story entitled “The Storm of Friday” which told of a storm with strong winds that hit the area. This was the same day that the Wallingford Tornado hit down in Connecticut. Walter was mentioned in this story where it said “In Manchester Walter Bond was prostrated while at work in the cloth room of the Amoskeag mills.”
In the 1880 census he was 20 still living at home in ward 6 of Manchester New Hampshire. His father’s occupation was listed as Express Teamster. His occupation was listed as working in the cotton mill.

Interestingly on November 6th 1891 in Chicago Illinois a Walter P. Bond married an Abbie M. Fuller. This may not have been them but none the less it is interesting considering his later practice of marring his third wife in Michigan.

There is also a rumor he went to Australia looking for diamonds at some point.
