He was a yeoman.

He married Martha Hale (Unknown-Unknown) on December 8th 1715 in Bradford Massachusetts.

He drowned in the Merrimack River on May 1st 1721. One source says his entire family minus his wife and Dr. John Bond drowned at the same time but other sources strongly seem to disprove that.

His wife remarried to Samuel Graves before 1725. Samuel Graves administered the estate of John Bond on June 5th 1721.

In an attempted to locate his burial place Pentucket Cemetery in Haverhill Massachusetts was searched but no gravestone for him was located. This in no way means he was or was not buried in that cemetery.

He had at least 3 children who were: 
    • Sarah Bond (1716-Unknown)
    • Dr. John Bond Sr. (1718-1804)
    • Jonathan Bond (1721-Unknown)
