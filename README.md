Genealogy
=========

Welcome to my git hub genealogy page. This repository contains all the work from
my "The Genealogy of our Family" book. I am converting it over to a repository
format to allow for easier updates. I have this licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

The directories included are:

  * notes 
  * people
  * resources 
  * zeroth_edition

The notes directory contains pieces of information from ongoing work. Nothing in
this directory should be taken as fact. Please consult with the user given by
"git blame" if you are interested in information contained within.

The people directory contains subdirectories containing a single person. Each
person's directory contains meta-data, text files, and links to other people.
Each person has symlinks to their parents and children here.

The resources directory contains files containing sources of facts. Note all
sources are contained here but some which are useful for researchers will be.

The zeroth_edition directory contains the source and pdf of my first book.
