Hannah Grace Bond to John Bond (Bond Line)
The Bond family name originally comes from the Norman name for freeman or husbandman. These were Normans who came over with William the Conquer in 1066 A.D. and conquered the Saxons. They were descendants of the Viking warriors. Our specific line can only be traced back to the first Bond settlers of our line in New England. These Bond were among the first settlers of Newbury and Haverhill in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Later the family was influential in Hampstead New Hampshire and finally in the Bow and Manchester New Hampshire region.
