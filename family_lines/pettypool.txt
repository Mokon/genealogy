Esther A. Pettypool to Burham Pettypool (Pettypool Line)
The Pettypool family name comes from the Anglo-Saxon peoples in England. It may have come from a nickname given to a short person: the old French word petit. It has many variants including Pettypoole, Pettipool(e), P’Pool(e), P.Pool(e), Ppool(e), and Pool(e). Our family line comes from an indentured servant who came here to the new world. He and his offspring would prove to be frontiers men, always pushing forward whether the frontier was that of Virginia, Tennessee, or Illinois. They finally came to settle in Michigan.
