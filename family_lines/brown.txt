Susie Mildred Josephine Brown to John Brown (Brown Line)
The Brown family name traces back to a nickname for various descriptions including people dark in color, with brown hair, or for clothing worn. It was not common after the Norman conquests in 1066 and most likely developed after that. Our line traces back to the founding of Hampton New Hampshire Later the family was a long line of farmers who finally settled in the Tilton New Hampshire area. Some sources trace this line even further back to nobility in England but there is a lack of primary sources for much of this genealogy in England. Please treat this line as highly suspect once you get to England.
