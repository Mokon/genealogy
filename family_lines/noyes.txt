Sarah E. Noyes to Robert Noyes (Noyes Line)
The Noyes family name is an ancient Norman name appearing shortly after 1066 AD in England. Our line traces back into England where they were originally farmers and later preachers. As Puritans they came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony to escape persecution in England. This family was instrumental in the founding of Newbury Massachusetts where Nicholas Noyes was a leader in the founding of the town. This line continued to produce notable offspring who were attorneysâ€™, representatives, blacksmiths, and farmers. They move from Massachusetts up into modern day Suncook and then into the Bow area.
